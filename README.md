Forecasting the prices of agricultural commodities using LSTNets

LSTNets are used beacause the data is Sequential and Time-Series.
Since the data contains both Linear and Non-linear patterns and also the future price depends on the short-term as well as long-term dependencies, so LSTM/LSTNets are used to forecast the prices of agricultural commodities.
